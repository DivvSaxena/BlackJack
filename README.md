This is a simple implementation of the classic BlackJack game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this game, you can play as the player against the computer dealer. The goal is to get a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Click the "Deal" button to start a new game.
4. You and the dealer will be dealt two cards each.
5. You can click the "Hit" button to request another card, or the "Stand" button to keep your current hand.
6. The dealer will then play its hand according to the standard BlackJack rules.
7. If your hand value is closer to 21 than the dealer's, or if the dealer busts (exceeds 21), you win!
8. Enjoy the game and have fun!
